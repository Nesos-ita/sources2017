## PONG

* Level 1: So much pixels and fun!

* Level 2: Ready for another match? :P

## How to run

In the `deployed` folder, there is the pre-built challenge. Pong has a client as well :) You can find the client in the `pong_client` folder.

During the CTF, we deployed the executable `pong`, and you connected to it using the client, i.e., `./pong_client pong.chall.polictf.it 31337`. You could download all the serversâ€™ binaries (the server and the two levels) and the client.

## How to build

See `build.sh` 

## How to solve

*** SPOILER ALERT ***

You can find the exploits in the `solution` folder.
